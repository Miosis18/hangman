## About The Project

I was asked too make a very basic two player hangman game for university for my upcoming assignment. I misread the assignment and made it for a single player.<br>

I was happy with the end result and decided to upload it here instead of letting it fester on my harddrive.



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Ensure you have python 3 installed on your computer.

Download the .py and the .json file ensuring names are not changed and they are located within the same file.

### Guide

This is an example of how to run the script once you have downloaded it.
* CD into directory containing the .py and .json
  ```sh
  cd hangman_game
  ```
  
* Run the program
  * Windows
    ```sh
    python hangman.py
    ```
  
  * Linux
  ```sh
  python3 hangman.py
  ```
